          <h1>About us</h1>
          <p>Audio Visions has been in business for over 40 years. We are commited to you and your event!</p>
          <p>Booking early is always a good idea. Booking occurs on a first come, first serve basis so the system that you wish to rent may or may not be available. Dates on or around holidays such as Christmas, New Years, and Valentines Day need to be booked early to ensure availabilty because the spots fill up very quickly. Call today for date availability.</p>
          <p>We screen all music with questionable lyrics for any church function or any event where there may be a concern for bad lyrics. We have done many church funcions for all faiths during our 25 years of business and have many references. Just give us a call if you have any concerns about this or would like reference contacts.</p>
          <p>We don't requre payment until directly following the event (Unless other arrangements have been made) We don't even require a deposit. The only thing we ask for is a signed contract prior to the event. We feel that you should not have to pay us money until we have fulfilled our obligation by performing our services.</p>
